Description: Minimal, zero-config readline replacement (development files)
 A small, self-contained line editing library providing line editing,
 history, completion, hints, and multi-line support with a BSD license.
 This development package installs the shared library symlinks and header
 for building software against linenoise. A static library can be produced
 by running 'make static' but is not installed by default.
